# DECISIONS.md

Running log of judgment calls made while building the app (per TASKS.md ground
rule 10). Newest at the bottom of each phase.

## Phase 0

- **Node runtime:** TASKS.md targets Node 22. The local dev machine runs Node
  20.12. CI pins Node 22. The codebase is Node-22-compatible; `engines.node` is
  set to `>=20.12.0` so local builds work while CI validates the target. No
  Node-22-only syntax is used.
- **Package manager:** pnpm 9.15.9 (activated via Corepack).
- **Build tooling:** each package builds with plain `tsc` (no bundler) to keep
  the toolchain minimal and debuggable; libraries emit `dist/` with
  declarations. Apps (NestJS/Next.js) use their own framework builds.
- **ESLint:** flat config (`eslint.config.js`) with `typescript-eslint`, since
  ESLint 9 is current. `no-explicit-any` is an error in domain code (ground
  rule 1), relaxed only in test files.
- **Module system:** ESM everywhere (`"type": "module"`), TS `NodeNext`
  resolution. Relative imports use explicit `.js` extensions.
- **LLM default model:** `claude-sonnet-5` (a current Sonnet-class model) per
  spec §4.1 / TASKS T1.5. Configurable via `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`.
